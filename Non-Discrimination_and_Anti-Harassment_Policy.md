# CodingNomads Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy

## INTENT

CodingNomads believes that respectful, professional conduct furthers the Company’s mission, promotes productivity, minimizes disputes, and enhances our reputation. CodingNomads expects every employee, contractor, student and mentor to show respect for all of our colleagues, customers, and fellow students. Harassment by fellow students, instructors, mentors, or any third parties is a form of misconduct that destroys our work environment and undermines our integrity. CodingNomads is committed to providing an educational and work environment that is free of unlawful discrimination, including harassment that is based on any legally protected status. CodingNomads will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment that violates this policy.

## NON-DISCRIMINATION

CodingNomads does not tolerate discrimination in any form on the basis of race, color, religion, disability, national origin, genetic information, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity and expression), marital status, protected veterans status, citizenship status or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.

Employees, contractors, students and mentors with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination experienced within the context of CodingNomads are strongly encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of Ryan & Kim Desmond. All employees, contractors, students and mentors can voice concerns and submit reports without fear of retaliation. Any CodingNomads employee, contractor, student or mentor found to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or expulsion from any and all courses for which a student is enrolled.

## HARASSMENT PROHIBITED

We will provide a safe and pleasant work and study environment where everyone is treated with fairness and respect. It is against Company policy for any employee to verbally or physically harass or discriminate against another employee on the basis of an individual’s race, color, religion, national origin, genetic information, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity and expression), marital status, protected veterans status, citizenship status or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. Harassment of employees in the CodingNomads workplace by any third party will not be tolerated either. Any employee, contractor, student or mentor who violates the company policy against harassment will be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination and/or expulsion.

The conduct prohibited by this policy, whether verbal, physical, or visual, includes any discriminatory employment action and any welcome or unwelcome conduct that is inflicted on someone because of that individual’s protected status. Among the types of conduct prohibited by this policy are epithets, slurs, jokes, negative stereotyping, intimidating acts, and the circulation or posting of written or graphic materials that show hostility toward individuals because of their protected status. The company prohibits that conduct in the workplace and in class, even if the conduct is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute unlawful harassment.

## SEXUAL HARASSMENT

Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances. 

This policy forbids harassment based on gender regardless of whether the offensive conduct is sexual in nature and regardless of whether it rises to the level of a legal violation. Any unwelcome conduct based on gender is also forbidden by this policy regardless of whether the individual engaged in harassment and the individual being harassed are of the same or are of different genders.

Examples of gender-based harassment forbidden by this policy include (1) offensive sex-oriented verbal kidding, teasing or jokes; (2) repeated unwanted sexual flirtations, advances or propositions; (3) verbal abuse of a sexual nature; (4) graphic or degrading comments about an individual’s appearance or sexual activity; (5) offensive visual conduct, including leering, making sexual gestures, the display of offensive sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters; (6) unwelcome pressure for sexual activity; (7) offensively suggestive or obscene letters, notes or invitations; or (8) offensive physical contact such as patting, grabbing, pinching, or brushing against another’s body.

## REPORTING PROCEDURES

Any employee who believes he or she has experienced or witnessed any conduct that is in violation of this policy should report that concern to Ryan & Kim Desmond immediately. This policy does not require reporting harassment to any individual who is creating the harassment.

Complaints may be made orally or in writing. If a complaint is made orally, the employee may be asked for a written statement during the investigation. All complaints, to the extent possible, should include dates, times, location, details of the incident(s), names of the individuals involved and the names of witnesses to the incident(s). Any instructor, employee, student or mentor who is aware of conduct inconsistent with this policy or who receives or learns of a report of conduct inconsistent with this policy must report such conduct immediately to Ryan & Kim Desmond.

## RESPONDING TO COMPLAINTS

All reports describing conduct that is inconsistent with this policy will be investigated promptly and thoroughly. Employees are required to cooperate in investigations. The Company is committed to maintaining confidentiality to the extent possible. The Company will take all reasonable measures to ensure that the situation is divulged only to those with a need to know.

## CORRECTIVE ACTION

CodingNomads will not tolerate any harassment or discrimination in violation of this policy. If an investigation reveals that a violation of this policy or other inappropriate conduct has occurred, then CodingNomads will take corrective action, including discipline, up to and including termination of employment or expulsion from all registered courses, as is appropriate under the circumstances, regardless of the job positions or course completion status of the parties involved. CodingNomads may discipline an employee, contractor or student for any inappropriate conduct discovered in investigating reports made under this policy, regardless of whether the conduct amounts to a violation of law. If the person who engaged in conduct in violation of this policy is not a CodingNomads employee, contractor or student, then we will take whatever corrective action is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.

## RETALIATION PROHIBITED

Retaliatory treatment of any employee for reporting discrimination, harassment or other prohibited behavior or for cooperating in a harassment investigation is strictly forbidden. All employees, contractors or students who experience or witness any conduct they believe to be retaliatory should immediately report such conduct to Ryan & Kim Desmond.

## A BETTER FUTURE

Together, let us build a better future. One where all individuals feel safe, secure, comfortable and productive at all times in their workplace and place of study.
